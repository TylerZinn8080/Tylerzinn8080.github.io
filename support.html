    <h2>About CoreReset</h2>

    <p>
      CoreReset is an AI powered emotional regulation app that helps users stop reactive patterns and respond with calm, grounded clarity in real time.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a text, comment, or boundary crossing triggers an emotional reaction, CoreReset analyzes what happened and generates a clear, practical response the user can apply immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not journaling.<br>
      This is not therapy.<br>
      This is AI guided emotional clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      CoreReset is not a medical or mental health service and does not provide diagnosis or treatment.
    </p>
